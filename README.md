# PyMamba

PyMamba is a Python database library which utilises LMDB as a storage engine. It's name is derived from the
*Black Mamba* which is the fastest snake on the planet. Typically PyMamba is a number of orders of magnitude
faster than alternatives such as MySQL or MongoDB, the trade-off is a reduced feature-set and language
portability.

After experimenting with readthedocs.org I've settled on self-hosted Sphinx API documentation, this may change
if issued with RTD can be resolved.
